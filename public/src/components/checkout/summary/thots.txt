so, the order and payment thing
i need to ensure that an order is successfully created before allowing the 
payment to go through
the issue is, the button thing doesn't seem to have a pre-transfer hook 
where i could ensure an order was made
it might but probably take a week to figure out

instead, what i can do is...
i can revert it to like traversy had where the review page takes to payment page
so that it's 100% created 
what i wanted was for the order and payment to happen on the same page
so what if a user makes an order, gets to the payment page, and spaces out
then i've got a bunch of unpaid orders that the user may or maynot log back in to pay

oh, so what if i use a useEffect to create the order on page load of the payment page
and if there's an error disable the payment button instructing user to try refreshing the 

thats good but, the user can still get to that page and not pay,
leaving a blank order which would deplete the stock that i could safely sell,
and would leave me open to bot attack
being that they could order all items without paying and deplete the stock from the front end

it would be so much cooler if i could just make a pre-order thing on the button.
uhg
